# Pintos Project #1: Threads

In this project, you'll get hands-on experience by implementing core threading features in a real operating system.  
It‚Äôs a great opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts we‚Äôve covered in class to a working OS kernel.

Please refer to the Printos Project #1 lecture slides for detailed instructions and guidelines.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Implementation Order

We recommend implementing the features in the following order:

1. **Alarm Clock**
2. **Priority Scheduling**
3. **Advanced Scheduler (4.4BSD MLFQ)**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

To compile the project, run the following commands:

```sh
cd threads
make
```

Make sure there are no errors before proceeding to testing.

## üß™ Running Tests

We provide scripts to simplify the testing process.

### Run all or individual test groups using `test.sh`:

```sh
bash test.sh alarm      # Run all alarm clock tests
bash test.sh priority   # Run all priority scheduler tests
bash test.sh mlfqs      # Run all MLFQS tests
bash test.sh all        # Run all tests
```

### Run a specific test case using `test_each.sh`:

```sh
bash test_each.sh alarm-single # Run alarm-single test case
```

### Check your test scores using `grade.sh`:

```sh
bash grade.sh
```

Example output:

```
TOTAL TESTING SCORE: 0.0%
